## About

This is a Rust/WASM reimplementation of the <a href="https://github.com/TyberiusPrime/dicodon_optimizer">'Dicodon optimizer'</a>
that was running on google app engine until August 2021.

You can use it to optimize the coding sequene of a gene to the dicodon usage of your organism of choice.

This leads to improved gene expression.
